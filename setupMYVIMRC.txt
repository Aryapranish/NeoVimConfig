NVIM config:

.config/nvim file

to edit init.lua:

open init.lua command:
:call mkdir(stdpath("config"),"p")

:exe "edit" stdpath("config") . "/init/lua"

:w

now you can easily type:
:edit $MYVIMRC

vim.keymap.set({mode},{lhs},{rhs},{opts})

{mode} - mode is where the keybinding should execute. Eg:
	-> n: Normal mode
	-> i: insert mode
	-> x: Visual mode
	-> s: Selection mode
	-> v: Visual + selection mode
	-> t: Terminal mode
	-> o: Operator-pending
	-> '': n + v + o

{lhs} - the key to bind

{rhs} - the key to execute

{opts} - lua table (place to store several values in one place, like a dictionary)
	-> desc - string that describes what the keybinding does
	-> remap - Boolean that determines if the keymap is recursive. Default is false. Note to self research more on this.
	-> buffer - Boolean or a number. Keybinding will only be effective in the current file if set to true.
	-> silent - Boolean to show message or not. Default is false
Eg:- 
vim.keymap.set('n','<space>w','<cmd>write<CR>', {desc='Save'})


created ./lua/arya/init.lua file 
require directory arya in the nvim directory's init.lua file
inside arya/ create remap.lua file to remap things. 

Added Packer Sync to sync packages
added telescope under plugin/telescope.lua + added keymaps to it to search for things
